The DISQUS comment system replaces your WordPress comment system with your comments hosted and powered by DISQUS.

== Description ==

Disqus, pronounced "discuss", is a service and tool for web comments and
discussions. The Disqus comment system can be plugged into any website,
blog, or application. Disqus makes commenting easier and more interactive,
while connecting websites and commenters across a thriving discussion
community.

The Disqus for WordPress plugin seamlessly integrates using the Disqus API and by syncing with WordPress comments.

= Disqus for WordPress =

* Notifications and reply by email

== Installation ==

**NOTE: It is recommended that you backup your database before installing the plugin.**

1. Unpack archive to this archive to the 'wp-content/plugins/' directory inside
   of WordPress

  * Maintain the directory structure of the archive (all extracted files
    should exist in 'wp-content/plugins/disqus-comment-system/'

2. From your blog administration, click on Comments to change settings
   (WordPress 2.0 users can find the settings under Options > Disqus.)

== Upgrading ==

1. Replace the old plugin with the new plugin (the plugin must stay in
   the disqus directory).

2. Your blog will be in legacy mode until you complete the configuration.
   This just means that it is using JavaScript to pull the comments instead
   of the API.
