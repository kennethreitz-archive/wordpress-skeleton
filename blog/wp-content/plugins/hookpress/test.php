// test.php is a simple test script which accepts HTTP requests
// and logs all of the GET and POST parameters accepted. It is useful
// for debugging requests sent by HookPress and is offered purely
// as a tool and toy.
//
// You can move it to http://localhost/test.php, for example, which
// is particularly convenient.
// 
// Make sure that PHP has the ability to create a `test.log` file
// or else create a blank `test.log` file and make sure PHP is able
// to write to it.
