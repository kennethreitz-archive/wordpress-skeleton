Adds any number of extra fields in any number of additional boxes on the Write/Edit page in the Admin.

== Description ==

More Fields is a WordPress plugin that adds boxes to the Write/Edit page. These boxes contains input fields, so that additional (more) fields can be added to a post. For example, if you write about books, you can add a box where you can enter title and author, etc. The boxes can be placed either to the right or to the left on the Write/Edit page.

In addition, the new version of More Fields enables you to define post types, which are custom Write/Edit pages that contains a pre-defined set of boxes. For example, you write about books and you write about your holidays, then you can define a post type 'Book' and a post type 'Holiday' each containing the input boxes relevant to each type of text. You can also set pre-defined categories, tags and templates for each post type.

With More Fields you can:

1. Add any number of boxes with any number of field to the Write/Edit page.
1. Add text, textarea, wysiwyg, checkboxes, radiobuttons and select lists as your input fields.
1. Create custom Write/Edit pages with a pre-defined set of input boxes, custom set categories, tags and templates.
1. Create archives based on Custom Fields values with custom slugs
1. Create boxes and post types programatically so that they can be created from within other plugins
1. List posts based on post type under the Manage menu
1. Set visiblitiy of a post type based on user level
1. Set global visiblity of boxes, in addition to the 'Screen Options' available for each post type for each user.

This plugins was born out of the development work done for [Dagensskiva](http://dagensskiva.com/) and [Dagensbok](http://dagensbok.com/).
