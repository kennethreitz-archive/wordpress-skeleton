"If you are using a language other than english you may find that the plugin "

"installation of PHP supports the mbstring functions."

"Some related word forms should really be counted together, e.g., \"follow\", "
"\"follows\", and \"following\". By default, Similar Posts treats such "
"differences strictly but has two other algorithms which are more relaxed: "
"<em>stemming</em> and <em>fuzzy matching</em>. The stemming algorithm tries "
"to reduce related forms to their root stem. Stemming algorithms are provided "
"for english, german, spanish, french and italian but stemmers for other "
"languages can be created: see the help for instructions. Fuzzy matching uses "
"the \"metaphone\" algorithm to handle word variations. Note: both stemming "
"and fuzzy matching slow down the indexing more than a little. It is worth "
"experimenting with the three possibilities to see what improves the "
"similarity of posts in your particular circumstances."
