# WP Syntax w/ Clippy

WP-Syntax provides clean syntax highlighting for embedding source code within pages or posts.
And, thanks to [Kenneth Reitz](http://kennethreitz.com), it now supports Clippy from GitHub too :)


## Example

	<pre lang="python">
		for i in range(45):
			print i
	</pre>

**Note: ** This plugin is based upon the world of [rmm5t](http://ryan.mcgeary.org/wp-syntax/).
