	STARKERS

	Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme created 
	to act as a starting point for the theme designer.	Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic 
	markup, Starkers is the perfect 'blank slate' for 
	your WordPress projects, as it's a stripped-back 
	version of the 'default' theme.	Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed, 
	so you can use it for whatever you like â€” even 
	your commercial projects.
